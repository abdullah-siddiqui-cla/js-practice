# JavaScript Syntax and Methods Practice
## Objective
This exercise will help you practice JavaScript syntax and methods by implementing functionality based on provided pseudocode.

## 1. Variables and Data Types

- Create a variable `name` and assign it your name as a string.
- Create another variable `age` and assign it your `age` as a number.
- Log both variables to the console.
- Concatenate name and age into a sentence and log it.

## 2. Loops

- Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
- Use another loop to print only even numbers between 1 and 20.
- Reverse the order and print from 10 down to 1.

## 3. Array

- Create an array colors containing "red", "green", "blue".
- Add a new color to the end of the array.
- Remove the first element from the array.
- Log the length of the array.
Bonus: Sort the array alphabetically and log it.

## 4. Iterating Arrays

- Create an array numbers containing 5 random numbers.
- Use a loop to print each number.
- Use a method to find the largest number in the array and log it.
- Use a method to sum all numbers in the array.
