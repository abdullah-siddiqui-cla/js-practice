# JavaScript Syntax and Methods Practice
## Objective
This exercise will help you practice JavaScript syntax and methods by implementing functionality based on provided pseudocode.

## 1. Variables and Data Types

- Create a variable `name` and assign it your name as a string.
- Create another variable `age` and assign it your `age` as a number.
- Log both variables to the console.
- Concatenate name and age into a sentence and log it.

## 2. Loops

- Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
- Use another loop to print only even numbers between 1 and 20.
- Reverse the order and print from 10 down to 1.

## 3. Array

- Create an array colors containing "red", "green", "blue".
- Add a new color to the end of the array.
- Remove the first element from the array.
- Log the length of the array.

## 4. Iterating Arrays

- Create an array numbers containing 5 random numbers.
- Use a loop to print each number.
- Use a method to find the largest number in the array and log it.
- Use a method to sum all numbers in the array.

## 5. String Methods
- Create a string sentence with the value "JavaScript is fun!"
- Convert it to uppercase and log it.
- Replace "fun" with "awesome" and log the result.
- Split the string into an array of words and log the array.

## 6. Callback Functions
- Write a function calculate(a, b, operation) that accepts two numbers and a callback function.
- Pass a function to calculate to multiply the numbers.

## 7. Objects
- Create an object person with properties name, age, and hobbies (an array).
- Add a method introduce to log "Hi, I'm [name] and Iâ€™m [age] years old."
Call the introduce method.

## 8. Nested Objects
- Create an object library with properties name and books (an array of objects, each with title and author).
- Log all book titles in the library.

## 9. Filter and Map
- Create an array numbers containing random integers between 1 and 50.
- Use a method to filter out even numbers and log the result.
- Use another method to multiply all numbers in the filtered array by 2 and log the new array.
- Chain the methods to perform both operations in one line.

## 10. Reduce
- Create an array expenses with numbers representing daily expenses for a week.
- Use a method to calculate the total expenses and log the result.
- Calculate the average expense and log it.

## 11. Find & Find Index
- Create an array words with random strings of different lengths.
- Use a method to find the first word that has more than 5 characters and log it.
- Log the index of the found word.

## 12. Substring Finder
- Write a function containsSubstring(str, substr) that returns true if str contains substr and false otherwise.
- Test the function with the strings "JavaScript is fun!" and "fun".

## 13. Nested Object Manipulation
- Create an object company with properties:
  - name (string)
  - departments (array of objects, each with `name` and `employees` array).
- Add a new employee to the `HR` department.
- Log the total number of employees in all departments.
- Write a function findDepartment(deptName) that returns the department object by name.

## 14. Merging Arrays of Objects
- Create two arrays `studentsBatch1` and `studentsBatch2`, each containing student objects with properties `id` and `name`.
- Write a function `mergeStudents(batch1, batch2)` that merges the arrays into one, ensuring no duplicate ids.
- Log the resulting array.

## 15. Capitalize Every Word
- Write a function `capitalizeWords(str)` that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
- Test it with the sentence: "this is a test sentence."
- Handle edge cases like extra spaces or empty strings.
